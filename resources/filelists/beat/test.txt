DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_0.wav|so this may be an interesting debate
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_1.wav|because much of my work my training
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_2.wav|is in the field of anti-aging
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_3.wav|or it's more popularly known as longevity
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_4.wav|so if you were to google right now longevity you will get a huge amount of results
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_5.wav|because not only yeah everybody wants to live longer and maybe because of
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_6.wav|they want to live longer because of health they want to live longer to spend time with her family they have a many many reasons
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_7.wav|i want to live longer to have more adventures
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_9.wav|yeah everybody has
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_10.wav|yeah exactly so you have your own reason but i
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_11.wav|think ultimately people are still very invested with
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_14.wav|way to live longer
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_15.wav|such as exercise nutrition taking
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_16.wav|care of yourself is not as
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_17.wav|it's not as adopted is people do not do this this as much as they should
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_18.wav|because they have started to they have started to rely on medicine i think because in the last century modern medicine
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_22.wav|people sometimes get very relaxed and start taking not they start taking less care of themselves because they think
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_23.wav|a doctor will fix me medicine will fix me
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_24.wav|just because the medicine is available old does not mean you have to use it
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_25.wav|especially if you get sick a lot of the medicine
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_26.wav|may only help you feel less sick but you are sick you're going to be sick for longer and longer periods of time it does not mean a cure if a medicine
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_28.wav|will help you
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_29.wav|yes exactly so
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_30.wav|i think people are living longer
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_31.wav|as a scientist i think people are living longer thanks to discover free
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_32.wav|of antibiotics that was a big
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_33.wav|problem in the past infection dying from infection
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_34.wav|not a lot of people understood about bacteria didn't even think bacteria existed a long long time ago
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_35.wav|so you would have illness and the illness would pass from person to person it would be contagious
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_36.wav|we are living through a pandemic
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_37.wav|this is just an idea of
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_38.wav|this is just this is an example of where we are at we do not understand the disease
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_39.wav|so we did research
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_40.wav|but unfortunately people were still dying we still don't understand
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_41.wav|the disease but as a result of
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_43.wav|we were somewhat able to up with a vaccine a vaccine of course you know that is not the cure to the to this illness
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_45.wav|it is helping people live longer because the discovery of things that used to kill that used to make people sick that used to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_47.wav|make your quality of life
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_49.wav|but i think as a result of much of the research within the past 100 years
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_50.wav|it also many of the
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_51.wav|research has shown there are preventative measures
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_52.wav|that you can take
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_54.wav|allow you to live longer however the idea being when you do live longer
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_55.wav|you have much more risk to develop aging
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_57.wav|these are things such as
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_58.wav|alzheimer's parkinson's neurodegenerative diseases just that when you get older the risks of becoming sick are very very great cancer cancer is is is a product of age
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_59.wav|and that is why many companies that is why many companies are researching to make drugs
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_62.wav|but cancer is also a very complex biological process
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_63.wav|i would also say
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_64.wav|the way that we have grown we have evolved so have bacteria that trying to use and infect and reproduce
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_65.wav|but so has cancer which
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_67.wav|it's not us it is a cell that has been
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_70.wav|is using us almost as it's like a parasite
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_71.wav|and there is not one way to fix it and there are certain things that you can do to prevent cancer but there's no cure for cancer
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_72.wav|and as you live longer and longer and longer
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_73.wav|you need to be aware of the risk of developing
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_74.wav|this disease that can
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_75.wav|even yeah yeah yeah and even even with that when you do have cancer
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_76.wav|you can go through the treatment you can do the exercise you can still get cancer because of your kinetics
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_77.wav|and say that you do get cancer
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_78.wav|let's let's think about the hypothetical right
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_79.wav|you are healthy you go to dodgeball every day
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_80.wav|you eat a good steak
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_81.wav|you eat vegetables every day
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_82.wav|but because of
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_83.wav|your genetics sometimes or how you live your life if you're out in the sun so much you don't wear sunscreen you get skin cancer skin cancer and this is what i study skin cancer is the most common type of cancer
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_84.wav|because people don't realize that sun damage
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_86.wav|one way that you that it damages your your dna the the what makes your cells function
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_87.wav|you so you can be healthy you can do everything but because of genetics and mutations which is out of your control
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_88.wav|that will that will that can put you at risk of
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_89.wav|not living longer
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_90.wav|and it can be very frustrating for people because they can do everything right everything being eat well exercise be
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_91.wav|very successful in their job but they can still but that but but living longer is not in their control
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_92.wav|so i think now the
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_93.wav|the field of science the the science of longevity
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_95.wav|the next big area i'm trying to be involved in this area
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_96.wav|also because it has
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_97.wav|i've explained biological implications of biological consequences but i think it has economic consequences
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_98.wav|you think about very old society like japan where there people are aging and aging
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_99.wav|if they get sick that means they cannot work
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_100.wav|companies lose money it places more pressure on the medical field
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_101.wav|to spend money to use drugs
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_102.wav|so it affects
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_103.wav|living longer is not
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_104.wav|only one person it affects
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_105.wav|many many areas and that is i think
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_106.wav|since we have been
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_107.wav|we have advanced the field of medication now is the next step of trying to challenge
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_109.wav|genetics not to live forever i think that is where some people get can get very confused
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_110.wav|not live forever
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_111.wav|but to live
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_114.wav|what is the point what is the point if you get sick
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_115.wav|that you stay sick for 10 extra years 15 extra years
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_116.wav|you want to have those 10 years be
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_117.wav|where you're happy where you are successful whatever your success is you want it to be spending it
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_118.wav|in a very productive way but if you're sick
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_119.wav|in the hospital for those
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_120.wav|for that extra time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_121.wav|it does not make sense
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_122.wav|yes it's a waste it's a waste
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_123.wav|yes yeah so i think
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_124.wav|right now what i
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_125.wav|am focusing on is i mentioned skin cancer skin is my area of expertise
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_127.wav|currently cosmetics does not
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_129.wav|that level of
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_130.wav|analysis that you see is with like pharmaceutical companies pharmaceutical companies use research from labs
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_131.wav|to make better cancer drugs that make vaccines that make something to help the public
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_132.wav|cosmetics or more for making you look nice they don't actually affect your biology
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_133.wav|do you know do you know what i mean by that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_134.wav|makeup does not affect your skin
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_135.wav|right it makes you look
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_136.wav|the blush eyeliner doesn't it does not actually affect your skin though
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_9_9_138.wav|covers of wrinkles
