DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_100_100_1.wav|one time i felt culture shock in my own country just from going to san francisco
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_100_100_2.wav|i was walking in the wharf which is a huge tourist area surrounded by other tourists performers
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_100_100_3.wav|and homeless people all mixed together
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_100_100_4.wav|people are performing around you there are people trying to make money off the tourist population
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_100_100_5.wav|but some people are just handing out things to show their support for political candidates
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_100_100_6.wav|or to hand out information
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_100_100_7.wav|i was being handed things left and right
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_100_100_8.wav|and i was just taking them to make people happy
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_100_100_9.wav|until i took one guy's flyer and he started to scream at me that what i took cost 5 i tried to give back his fire and he said he wouldn't accept it
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_100_100_10.wav|for only five dollars after arguing with him that i wasn't going to give him five dollars i just dropped the flyers feet and walked away
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_101_101_0.wav|well yes i have experienced a paranormal event
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_101_101_1.wav|i was hanging out with my friends as you do when you're young and we were having drinks and we were a little toasted
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_101_101_2.wav|we lived with a roommate who was in the occult into the occult and the bizarre and happen to have a ouija board
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_101_101_3.wav|which is if you believe in that sort of thing allows you to speak to the dead
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_101_101_4.wav|we decided to turn on the cr tv which is the older tv in our house that still had a tube in it to put on white noise
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_101_101_5.wav|so we flipped it onto a channel with white snow we pull out the ouija board and start goofing off asking where we can get pizza
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_101_101_6.wav|who's going to buy the next beer etc
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_101_101_7.wav|about three minutes of this see our tv started going insane it started to flicker
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_101_101_8.wav|and change like something was trying to communicate with us
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_101_101_9.wav|we all decided to stop playing with the ouija board at that moment now i recall we forgot to say goodbye on the ouija board
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_102_102_0.wav|one time my friends and i dared each other other to go to a place that we believe was haunted
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_102_102_1.wav|mirror my house there was a creek that we were told bad things had happened there so we decided to go at midnight to try and scare ourselves
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_102_102_2.wav|it was difficult to even walk into that area as we were freaking out and terrified to go in
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_102_102_3.wav|it was quite scary
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_102_102_4.wav|truth be told we weren't able to go very far into the woods near the creek my friends and i kept playing claiming that we heard things felt things so he decided not to go to further
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_102_102_5.wav|i was pretty scared honestly so i'm glad we didn't go to much further into the woods i'm not quite
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_102_102_6.wav|too sure
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_102_102_7.wav|why we all thought that area was haunted we just thought it was based off of the stories that we were told it's cool
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_102_102_8.wav|of course there are probably non sent made up to scare other school children but it was still a fun and memorable time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_103_103_0.wav|when i was in university almost more than 10 years ago
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_103_103_1.wav|the community service security it was not very good and we are often more

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_103_103_6.wav|in serious situations
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_103_103_7.wav|when i was in university almost more than 10 years ago the community security was not very good when we were often
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_103_103_8.wav|more often than not in dangerous situations one time i was walking home from work waiting for the bus at a bus stop
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_103_103_9.wav|then i heard the sound of gunfire from across the road police cars came around and the police shot at other people across the street i was so scared the main reason was because you have no place to hide your at a bus station and there's no place to go
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_103_103_10.wav|there was another time i was los angeles driving i took the wrong road and went on a small local road and not exaggerating here but both sides of the road were full of homeless people
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_103_103_11.wav|these people were moving around on the road and i was just very nervous they ignore the traffic rules and they came right up to the car and made me stop my car
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_103_103_12.wav|they shook the car in swore at me i thought to myself
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_103_103_13.wav|this is horrible because a few days ago someone was shot dead and maybe i'll be next
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_104_104_0.wav|one thing that scared me was once when i was out driving at night trying to get gas well maybe it was a little bit after 12:00 i went to the gas station to fill up
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_104_104_1.wav|i was finishing up and i was checking out with my money then a woman suddenly jumped from the side of my car with blood on her face and i was like what's going on here and then she said
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_104_104_2.wav|i've been in a traffic accident can you give me some money i want to go home and i only had 20 on me so i gave her 20
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_104_104_3.wav|i said that's all i have she said
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_104_104_4.wav|20 is not enough
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_104_104_5.wav|i told her i couldn't help her
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_104_104_6.wav|i only have 20 she said will you can use your credit card you can go over there and get me money because we were at a gas station she told me to go inside the gas station to use my credit card to get money i told her
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_104_104_7.wav|forget that i can only help you hear 20 will do
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_104_104_8.wav|then when i look closely at her face i noticed she was quite young like a university student maybe she came here on purpose to ask for money
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_105_105_0.wav|one night i was out with my friends and we ended up going out to a bar i'm not too sure why we wanted to go to the bar but we ended up there nonetheless
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_105_105_1.wav|there were some guys there who harassing these women and we decided to say something to them to try and get the women out of there
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_105_105_2.wav|we walked up to these men and say hey what are you guys doing with a tone of authority
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_105_105_3.wav|the men stood up and the women took the chance to get out of there one of the men would a subset and the females left and was obsessed
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_105_105_4.wav|one of the and was upset that the females left and
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_105_105_5.wav|was was upset so he took a glass bottle and bash my friends
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_105_105_6.wav|face with it and ran out the bar i got a tiny shard of glass in my face but my friend was really cut up he had scars down the side of his face to this day from this event
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_106_106_0.wav|one night around 9 p.m i was heading home from work about midnight and i was walking up to my car suddenly two men came up to me and told me to empty my pockets i was reaching for my wallet
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_106_106_1.wav|but i guess i did too slowly for them because the next thing i knew i was being beaten by one of the men
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_106_106_2.wav|i think i took a hit to my nose which made me fall to the ground and then while i was on the ground they should decided to kick me in the face about three or four times
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_106_106_3.wav|i was laying there bleeding and spitting out blood they took my money
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_106_106_4.wav|and the worst thing that even though this was a robbery my company charged me for a replacement id so now i have less money it was an awful experience
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_107_107_0.wav|my japanese isn't very good but sometimes you've got to express yourself i went out to eat with a friend and tried my best to order food
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_107_107_1.wav|my friend convinced me that i said something wildly inappropriate to the waitress
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_107_107_2.wav|at this point i had a few drinks in me and i was nervous i really thought i said something that would really upset the person
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_107_107_3.wav|what could have i said i thought
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_107_107_4.wav|i was so nervous but it turns out he was just playing a joke on me i'd order my food and didn't say anything silly i was really worried
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_107_107_5.wav|and pounded down a shot of sake just because i was a bit stressed out after that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_107_107_6.wav|i learned never to trust this friend again
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_108_108_0.wav|one time i was searching for my friend in vietnam they had gotten themselves lost and i was wandering wandering around ho chi minh city trying my hardest to find them
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_108_108_1.wav|their phone was off and it was me versus the city trying to find her i had a picture of her on my phone so with broken vietnamese i spoke to everyone i could see in order to try and find her
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_108_108_2.wav|most people just laughed in my face i was worried that she was kidnapped or worse
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_108_108_3.wav|my heart was being faster than a dog's heart it was hot and i was what are you trying to find my friend
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_108_108_4.wav|i really thought all was lost and i would have to spend the rest of my trip at the police station waiting for her
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_108_108_5.wav|thankfully after a few hours of searching i finally found her near the hostel
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_108_108_6.wav|all i wanted to do was sit down and relax after talking to everybody seemingly in this to city and vietnam
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_109_109_0.wav|i think the first thing i go on when i go to amusement parks are the roller coasters i love going on them but this wasn't always the case i used to be terrified of them
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_109_109_1.wav|i think it's because i used to watch a lot of tv shows that showed accidents and crashes from amusement park rides
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_109_109_2.wav|i remember i used to ask the people who work there before on the garage i got on the rides
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_109_109_3.wav|has anyone ever been in accidents on this roller coaster
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_109_109_4.wav|i know now that most theme park workers don't care but their lack of an answer always scared me because what if i was this person to get heard on this ride
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_109_109_5.wav|but they do look a lot of fun so i always went on i guess that's the point is a roller coasters to do something daring that you normally would not do
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_10_10_0.wav|i would prefer to choose a major that is easy to find a good job in the future like finance or marketing for example there's no one that can deny the most common reason for attending university is to get prepared for a good job in the future
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_10_10_1.wav|so whether this major will lead to a good job or not is the most important reason why we choose our major
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_10_10_2.wav|if we find a good job with a decent payment we can use the money for what we have earned to satisfy our own interests
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_10_10_3.wav|for example i like painting a lot however i chose painting is my
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_10_10_4.wav|should i don't think i can make a lot of money as a painter but if i go for a major like finance i can get a finance-related job after graduation
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_10_10_5.wav|after university i can get a high salary and in my free time i can use my salary to hire professional teacher to teach me how to draw
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_110_110_0.wav|so i have a problem with roller coasters i think they're fun it's those huge drop towers that you see an amusement park set scare me to death
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_110_110_1.wav|normally they are so old and they haven't been serviced in about 100 years there's a long climb to the top and then that sudden drop my heart races so fast and i can't even look
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_110_110_2.wav|when i'm up that high
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_110_110_3.wav|i know that these things are designed to be safe but high places
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_110_110_4.wav|get me
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_110_110_5.wav|that feeling of butterflies in your stomach as you're falling to the ground
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_110_110_6.wav|hoping that the brakes fire on when they're supposed to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_110_110_7.wav|these rides are the worst and they scare me so bad but somehow whenever i go to the theme park i always get dragged to them
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_111_111_0.wav|some people pelting stones at dogs and watching them yelp and pain of used some little children begging on the streets
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_111_111_1.wav|people driving with mobile's glued to their ears women standing in metros while the male passengers nicely remain stuck to their seats or mobile
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_111_111_2.wav|talking loudly on the mobile often causing irritation of fellow passengers all these make me discussed
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_111_111_3.wav|another example is in the hospital there are almost 34 patients waiting before me people of all ages are here
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_111_111_4.wav|one thing that disgusted me here is that people are using mobile phones to watch youtube videos and other videos at high volume
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_111_111_5.wav|they almost have forgotten why they're here
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_111_111_6.wav|they broke the peace and around the hospital now mobile phones have become very close to everyone and some people can't live without using them
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_111_111_7.wav|i appreciate the technology but
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_111_111_8.wav|we should obey some basic etiquette
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_112_112_0.wav|i think i just like places that are crowded and people that act like they're crazy it could be a club a railway station or place where people are going insane situations like this make me feel uncomfortable especially when the place is too noisy or if i've been in an environment that is noisy for a long time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_112_112_1.wav|i don't like the feeling of being pressed against people
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_112_112_2.wav|i am also not used to being in a situation where there's a lot of a lot of loud noises all the time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_112_112_3.wav|i remember i was at a private party that was very be loud and it made me feel a little tired and sleepy
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_112_112_4.wav|so if i feel a little bit uncomfortable i usually drop my plans i know the place will be crawling with thousands of people
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_112_112_5.wav|also i don't like places where there's sunshine is too hot or the weather is extremely cold extreme cold extreme heat will make me a bit uncomfortable
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_113_113_0.wav|i don't like to go to clubs there are so many young people there and most of them will drink a lot and i don't like to drink much
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_113_113_1.wav|because i don't like to be drunk
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_113_113_2.wav|also some clubs are very noisy and play music that i don't like too much so really i don't like to go to clubs
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_113_113_3.wav|also in my opinion sometimes when people are drunk
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_113_113_4.wav|music is too loud and the place isn't really that safe everyone is really drunk and not able to have a real conversation i don't know what kind of person would like to go to a bar for anything other than drinking a beer
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_113_113_5.wav|i can do that at my house
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_114_114_0.wav|one place i hate going to is major sporting events these are there so many people packed into a small space
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_114_114_1.wav|the beer and booze is flowing like crazy and people get really drunk and then get upset when their their team doesn't win the ballgame i don't understand
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_114_114_2.wav|does everyone bet on these things is that why people get upset about losing people destroy the city if it was win or lose we live beyond the year 2000
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_114_114_3.wav|shouldn't we as a culture be beyond this i how
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_114_114_4.wav|man throws the ball well is a career choice that gets millions of dollars
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_114_114_5.wav|but hey if you need your kids to be educated thankfully they will be taught by someone who gets paid barely above minimum wage
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_114_114_6.wav|but i digress i don't think i'll ever go to a football game
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_114_114_7.wav|where the crowd goes insane i just wouldn't want to be there and have to pay a lot of money to not have a fun time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_115_115_0.wav|if i had to pick a place i would never in a million years return to it would be the place of business for my first job
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_115_115_1.wav|for legal reasons i won't describe much about it or the people that you could have found inside of the horde place however i will say that i imagine this place in my nightmares
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_115_115_2.wav|it was a poorly run and place and the management had an attitude if any of anything goes so many things were broken people would be in many places that were unsafe and the staff and customers would get i literally heard
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_115_115_3.wav|this was all received with a struggle to shoulders and saying of
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_115_115_4.wav|oh well what can you do there was a distinct feeling of negativity and a lack of responsibility
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_115_115_5.wav|the moment you walked into this building
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_115_115_6.wav|everyone was in on this everyone was just there to collect a paycheck should we improve to help the situation should we help the environment
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_115_115_7.wav|should we rebel against management or to make a safer working environment
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_115_115_8.wav|the answers to all these questions were always nah let's keep going the way it is because change is difficult
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_116_116_0.wav|people will pick
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_116_116_1.wav|the dmv as a place they never want to go to even in the movie zootopia it was shown to be staffed by sloths that are slow moving attempting to do their job
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_116_116_2.wav|but i've got a worse place for you that i don't wish on my worst enemy to visit that is the immigration office
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_116_116_3.wav|to be kind i'll be vague about the country that this place is in but anyone who has had the displeasure of going to immigration office knows this feeling

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_15_15_3.wav|however my family decided to move to japan because my grandfather was actually japanese
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_15_15_4.wav|it was not easy for us to leave her home town to live in a city where nobody knew us we found it hard to adapt to a new place and environment

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_15_15_6.wav|although we missed our family and village house a lot with slowly and steadily used to see life especially visiting shopping malls cafes parks playgrounds studying in libraries and other conveniences of living in a city
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_15_15_7.wav|i feel that although anyone will feel a little comfortable when they go from our from your place the variety of change will increase that person's experience in life

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_17_17_0.wav|no i don't really think that people should always tell the truth maybe it's my culture that makes me say that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_17_17_1.wav|but where i come from we aren't super direct so if someone comes up to you says

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_17_17_3.wav|now if it's a life-or-death situation you have to tell the truth but when it comes to situations where people's feelings might be hurt or really doesn't matter
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_17_17_4.wav|if it's the truth or not it is better to accept the lie for example would you walk into an elementary school and shout it's not they're lying to you santa claus isn't real of course not
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_17_17_5.wav|however you are lying to children because it's culturally okay because we were all involved in this lie

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_18_18_3.wav|as if they don't know someone could get hurt or arrested for the wrong information
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_18_18_4.wav|as a society we have to know that the truth is one of the most important things
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_18_18_5.wav|if we lie every day we have to keep up that lie and keeping up with lies means lying more in order to continue the story that you've got made up

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_18_18_7.wav|many people decide to continue the lie as it's easy until you get caught in the lie however we should always tell the truth as it is important when there are serious issues at hand
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_19_19_0.wav|it all depends on the context if you are traveling to see someone who is a medical emergency or you have a place to be
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_19_19_1.wav|or if you have a place to go to need to be in a limited amount of time the only way to go is by straight to the destination

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_1_1_1.wav|since i started my job i think it's very important to get a good sleep during your weekend because when you have to work monday through friday the whole week you are very tired

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_20_20_1.wav|when i say is fast as possible if the drive takes 12 hours we are going to take three calculated breaks so we can grab a bite to eat and use the restroom
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_20_20_2.wav|once we either use the facilities it is time to move so we can get to our destination i like to minimize the amount of time we were stopped and not moving
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_20_20_3.wav|once we get to the nest nation we don't have to worry about getting there and we can enjoy a time at the destination plus if you're on the road long enough you will run to traffic or delays and that could stop you from getting to your destination

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_21_21_1.wav|bruce campbell is a major star and b movies he was in a small budget horror movie called the evil dead that made him a horror movie star he's played the same character for over 40 years from the will dead his friend and director of the evil dead is a major director who made 2,000 spider-man movies
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_21_21_2.wav|because he's friends with bruce campbell sometimes he shows up in small roles in those films
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_21_21_3.wav|bruce campbell is an over-the-top actor that brings a fun performance to every role he does if you want to watch one of his movies i'd highly recommend either evil dead 2 or army of darkness both of those are really fun and not super scary
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_22_22_0.wav|if i had to pick my favorite actor i'd probably picked an actor and who's also not as well known i would choose an actor named adam goldberg he is fantastic in everything he is in however he gets cast and really bad movies
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_22_22_1.wav|he was in a movie called deja vu which also stars denzel washington

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_22_22_5.wav|but crime film with a light time travel element
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_22_22_6.wav|but if you want to see the reason why i think he's an amazing actor i would recommend seeing the film
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_22_22_7.wav|untitled he's the lead actor in the film about pretentious artists and it breaks down this strange society which is actually based on real people and their minimalist art works and their general insanity adam goldberg is fantastic in his role in that

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_24_24_5.wav|so if you're ever at a festival or at a mall that happens to have a greek restaurant i would highly recommend giving you as a shot
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_24_24_6.wav|however if you are vegetarian i'd recommend avoiding them as you probably won't enjoy the lamb meat inside
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_25_25_0.wav|one movie i would love to recommend to others would be the fall by an indian director that goes by the name tarsem
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_25_25_1.wav|i truly believe that this is a masterpiece involves a sick patient in a turn-of-the-century hospital telling a fantastical story to a young girl it's about a hero trying to find evil king with his team feature an explosive excerpt expert a warrior a bandit and charles darwin
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_25_25_2.wav|they formed together to take down the evil king and save a princess for marrying the evil king it's a visually fascinating film that was filmed in over 80 countries
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_25_25_3.wav|it features shots that were unique to this film and the story itself is multi-layered as the reality of the plot is that it's about an injured stunt actor explaining his experience in film to a young girl
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_25_25_4.wav|the film is a love letter to the works of buster keaton harold lloyd and charlie chaplin i would highly recommend this movie to everyone it has an impressive visual style that no other movie has and you get a mini trip around the world while you watch it
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_26_26_0.wav|there is a movie called time crimes that would i also would highly recommend it's a film from spain but if you're afraid to watch a movie that is in a completely different language you are in luck as they barely talk in this movie
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_26_26_1.wav|i apologize because i'm about to spoil this movie and half of the enjoyment is about learning what is happening while the film is going on
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_26_26_2.wav|a man moves into a new home near the woods and finds that there is someone in the woods behind his house he goes to investigate and finds a masked man stalking him through the woods he has to outwit the stalker and finds himself jumping into a machine to hide from him
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_26_26_3.wav|only to find that it was a time machine and he finds himself about four hours back in time and finds that he was the masked man that was stalking him
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_26_26_4.wav|in order to keep the loop going so that they're not too of him running around
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_26_26_5.wav|at the same time he must reenact the moves he saw himself do as the masked man
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_26_26_6.wav|now if that doesn't make you want to watch the movie there's still a huge chunk of the movie that i didn't mention about you should really see it for yourself in order to see how it turns out
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_27_27_0.wav|many people have seen the movie the matrix and say that is an interesting film
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_27_27_1.wav|but if you want to see a movie that is made by the same directors of the matrix i would highly recommend their overlooked film cloud atlas
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_27_27_2.wav|the film which stars tom hanks takes characters in different types of the earth the story bounces around from the 1800s the 1970s the present the near future and the far future
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_27_27_3.wav|every character that you see has a different role in each time period
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_27_27_4.wav|the film a plot about past lives and has different characters going through a character arc during those times
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_27_27_5.wav|it's a quite interesting to see how the characters change throughout the movie
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_27_27_6.wav|and you walk away from the film with more questions than answers
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_27_27_7.wav|some people like closed-ended stories but when you have endings that are open it allows you to think about what you watch and reflect on it this movie was a flop and theater is but it is worth your time to watch
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_28_28_0.wav|a game that has really made me think a lot would be the stanley parable in the game you find yourself as a man named stanley who's an office worker and realizes he's the only person in his office
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_28_28_1.wav|there is a narrator explaining
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_28_28_2.wav|the things that only stanley will do and as a casual player you simply can follow the voices instructions
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_28_28_3.wav|but if you decide to go against the narrator story the narrator will become flustered and confused as the players has seemingly free well
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_28_28_4.wav|for example
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_28_28_5.wav|you find yourself in front of two doors the narrator says that you will take the door on left if you choose the door on your right you'll find yourself in a room that is the same as the one you just left the narrator then says let's try this again
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_28_28_6.wav|i think the concept of free will that is given to you in what should be a straightforward follow the path game is incredibly interesting
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_28_28_7.wav|there are so many paths that you can take into this game and go against the way that you're supposed to complete it
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_29_29_0.wav|the last time i brought flowers was for my significant others birthday it was last month i think it's important to give flowers at important events as it signifies life and prosperity
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_29_29_1.wav|i think if i didn't get flowers for her i would probably make her upset
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_29_29_2.wav|but i really do think flowers liven up the room that they are in and it's nice for the while that they are blooming to look and water to keep them alive
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_29_29_3.wav|i think flowers express many different emotions such as love sympathy or it nations
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_29_29_4.wav|i would argue that people that grow and ship out flowers probably make a lot of money during holidays as they're so popular
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_29_29_5.wav|maybe i should look into becoming a florist i think it might be hard to keep my customers satisfied but they think but they need you for important events maybe i should go back and look at that profession a little bit more closely
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_29_29_6.wav|i think my favorite flower is a sunflower as they are able to give you something more to look at their seeds are very tasty as well
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_30_30_0.wav|i can't remember the last time i gave out flowers flowers are just really beautiful when they're blooming however after you put them in a vase and water them they will only be around for maybe a week or two what's the point of something that only lasts a little bit of time why waste money on basically ending a plant's life so you can enjoy its flower for a short amount of time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_30_30_1.wav|i feel the same way about christmas trees wouldn't you say that buying something someone something more practical
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_30_30_2.wav|to someone's life is better than just a flower
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_30_30_3.wav|i believe that i try to find things that are useful for the person rather than just seeing something pretty for a little while
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_30_30_4.wav|watching a flower wilt away to a brown husk is actually more depressing and will make you remove the flower the second it starts turning brown
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_30_30_5.wav|that isn't to say i don't like flowers i like them i just don't like things that are wasted by
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_30_30_6.wav|if i had to pick a flower then i would pick a rose because roses are multi-layer they have beauty of the petals and pain with its lawrence
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_31_31_0.wav|my favorite festival is in october can you guess what it is it's halloween i think halloween is a very unique festival
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_31_31_1.wav|as where i'm from there are not many social festivals that don't involve your core family
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_31_31_2.wav|you can celebrate halloween with anyone i think halloween is quite interesting as you're able to do it with you are able to be whomever you'd like you can dress up and become something cute something scary
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_31_31_3.wav|i think my favorite thing about halloween is the haunted house is i'm a big fan of feeling the rush of scared i think haunted houses are a lot of fun
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_31_31_4.wav|however i completely understand if someone wouldn't want to go and was as they can be really scary
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_31_31_5.wav|i wish there were more haunted houses that were around more than just
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_31_31_6.wav|during halloween i think i would go on every one every one to two months
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_31_31_7.wav|but if you have kids halloween is fine because your children get to play pretend and then that's their favorite characters and they get a kind of candy that they can eat throughout the year
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_32_32_0.wav|i think my favorite festival is thanksgiving during the holiday season you have three back-to-back celebrations thanksgiving christmas and new year's
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_32_32_1.wav|christmas is nice but it requires you to do a lot of work to make other people happy
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_32_32_2.wav|also christmas is extremely stressful as you have to fight in stores to get the presents that people want
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_32_32_3.wav|it can also be extremely expensive
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_32_32_4.wav|new year's is fun but it gets crazy and i'm not a night owl so i'd rather be done celebrating by 10 p.m
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_32_32_5.wav|thanksgiving is great because it's just a day where you can eat and cook and enjoy time with your family and friends
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_32_32_6.wav|i really like to cook a nice tasty turkey for everyone to enjoy
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_32_32_7.wav|i think we all enjoy a good meal together or watch a movie
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_32_32_8.wav|show as a family and then see each other again on christmas
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_32_32_9.wav|it's a simple experience that families can have together sometimes however people get pretty tense with upsetting comments at the dinner table however it's only usually a few hours long compared to an entire day
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_33_33_0.wav|one application that i use a lot in my phone is called imovie this app is pretty useful for expressing yourself
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_33_33_1.wav|you can find this app in the app store on phones using apple ios i'm not sure how much it costs now however when i got it it was free
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_33_33_2.wav|however that was roughly eight years ago with imovie you can edit your video clips together in order for you to tell a story or visually express yourself to show how you feel or how people show things how people
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_33_33_3.wav|or show people how things work
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_33_33_4.wav|my favorite thing to do with imovies to make videos i show people things that may or may not see
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_33_33_5.wav|whenever i go on vacation i'm constantly filming i love showing the world and the story about the interesting thing that i want to show
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_33_33_6.wav|and helping people learn more about it
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_33_33_7.wav|however imovie does crush a lot sometimes you can finish a project to find that everything that you've done has disappeared
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_33_33_8.wav|there's really no way to save your work on the phone as there's no interface to do that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_34_34_0.wav|one app i'm not proud to say used a lot is the facebook app it connects you with her friends and family but it really sucks you in and kind of makes you become a zombie as you walk around looking down on your phone for hours at a time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_34_34_1.wav|i don't know if others feel this way but i think the connection to the digital world distracts
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_35_35_0.wav|the real world is that the future is that what will strive to do leave likes and comments and cute on i was
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_35_35_1.wav|constantly scrolling up and down on the app waiting for new images and post to come in so we can watch in silence
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_35_35_2.wav|this is a problem that is quite a dilemma
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_35_35_3.wav|there will be younger people that will be raised by apps like facebook they might need to be liked and it's a different human experience that has it been on this planet before
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_35_35_4.wav|long time ago i moved to japan from america i was told i was going to experience a lot of culture shock other
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_35_35_5.wav|than the language which even now i'm still having trouble getting the hang of i've never really found myself with much of an issue
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_35_35_6.wav|however i would never under any circumstances recommend someone to move to van during august as it is so hot i'm pretty sure that you could cook an egg on the street and s
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_35_35_7.wav|having to lug around a couple of suitcases full of your stuff is pretty rough not to mention you'll have to bring them up hills and inclines and really hot
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_35_35_8.wav|weather if i could have i wish i would have moved to japan and fall or spring as it is much cooler
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_35_35_9.wav|i believe that if i came during those times i wouldn't realize how hot it truly is in the summer months it made me learn that i probably should prepare for brutally hot summers in japan
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_36_36_0.wav|when i started my university studies i found myself in one of the biggest campuses in the nation not knowing what to do or where to go when classes start is was a big worry for me
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_36_36_1.wav|so i took it upon myself to walk around the entire campus twice
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_36_36_2.wav|i want to mention that my school was over two miles long i spent the whole day wandering around the buildings including the ones i knew i'd be spending a lot of time in it was quite an adventure
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_36_36_3.wav|i learned about the club's i couldn't join an extracurricular activities i could be of
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_36_36_4.wav|this allowed me to be pretty knowledgeable about the things i could do on campus some of my roommates were foreign exchange students that i later met in university life so i was able to show them around easily
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_37_37_0.wav|when i was in university there was only one correct answer to tell you my favorite restaurant that answer is lazy moon it is one of the best pizza places on the planet
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_37_37_1.wav|let me get into the reasons why this place is the best
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_37_37_3.wav|it's cheap
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_37_37_4.wav|you can get under you can get a slice of pizza for the size of your chest and a cold beer for under five dollars second oh man
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_37_37_5.wav|the pizza is good you think 45 what bucks you'd get a doughy pizza but it is always a perfect slice of pizza pie
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_37_37_6.wav|since i left the city the single restaurant has expanded into a chain into the city is in
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_37_37_7.wav|that is what they call a win
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_37_37_8.wav|not only can i get an amazing pizza i can amazing pizza in multiple places throughout the city
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_37_37_9.wav|i can tell you that i spent at least 40 a month at this restaurant and if i still live in the city i went to university and i'd probably still be doing the same
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_38_38_0.wav|my favorite place i live
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_38_38_1.wav|my favorite place in the city i live in is probably tokyo disneysea
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_38_38_2.wav|i know what you're saying your favorite place in the world is a theme park are you a little old for that kind of thing
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_38_38_3.wav|well i think that is one of the most interesting places in the world it's one of the most unique and impressive theme parks built by disney rides are incredible and it might be the best theme park in the world the only thing i don't like about the park is how busy it can be
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_38_38_4.wav|it's so packed to the brim room with people and
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_38_38_5.wav|it's amazing because it's just huge i don't know how many people
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_38_38_6.wav|have the day off at the same time to actually go to places like this
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_38_38_7.wav|then again i guess because disney is a household name it makes people want to go here rather than a smaller local theme park
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_38_38_8.wav|if there was a way to bring the prices
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_38_38_9.wav|down on the food a little bit that would make the experience better that they're better to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_38_38_10.wav|but i don't think there's a chance that we'll ever do that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_39_39_0.wav|so there are parents that will allow their children to spend their money as they like and then there are some that are tightly controlling their money
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_39_39_1.wav|recently an adult musician named britney spears was just released from her father's power over her money as a musician
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_39_39_2.wav|so sometimes that goes behind truck goes beyond childhood into adulthood
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_39_39_3.wav|but i think it's better take a little bit from both to allow children to know that they can spend money but at the same time i'm
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_39_39_4.wav|have to understand that you can't just buy everything that you want
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_39_39_5.wav|if you can't let children use the money that they've earned they might become upset and asked why did they are in the money anyway if you allow them to purchase things that they find important they will be happy but you can't just let children spend their money on everything they will see like monopoly money so you have to educate your children how to use and when to use their money intelligently
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_40_40_0.wav|i think it is incredibly important to control your children's money
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_40_40_1.wav|the reason i say this because is
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_40_40_2.wav|have you ever seen what children by they have no concept of the value of the dollar so they will use their money for silly things toys that break it moment sugary candy and things they'll forget moments after they purchase them they may be earning money but you have to teach them that you can't just toss money down the toilet if you control their money you will be able to teach them how to save and possibly the concept but man if you could explain why they would enjoy investing their money in the future
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_40_40_3.wav|could get them more of what they want
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_40_40_4.wav|i think this ability to buy anything they want
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_40_40_5.wav|but not be able to purchase without parental permit parental permission would allow them to grow as a consumer
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_40_40_6.wav|not to be forced by commercials that say you must buy this i think too much is forced upon young buyers this allows them to look logically at their decisions
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_41_41_0.wav|i would much rather take a very long vacation than to pull short ones
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_41_41_1.wav|as when you are a long vacation you can enjoy everything you can stop and smell the roses as they say

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_41_41_6.wav|as of right now it just seems like i work every day with little pay off
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_42_42_0.wav|realistically how can one take very long vacations you have to take time off work in order to get free time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_42_42_1.wav|i can't think of many companies that enjoying their employees off for two weeks at a time to travel for fun
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_42_42_2.wav|i think it's much more important to take small short vacations
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_42_42_3.wav|enjoy those special holiday weekends where you get three or four days off and go someplace to enjoy and relax and then come back
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_42_42_4.wav|i think going to places for a long time is a waste because after two or three days of being there you've mostly seen everything already
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_42_42_5.wav|short vacations are great because it gives you just enough time to explore how fun and leave more to come in the future

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_43_43_3.wav|i would talk about how this person is known for jumping to conclusions and not kissing on facts but rather what they felt at the time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_43_43_4.wav|i would bring their character in the conversation ask if they have heard anything else from that person and that was wild

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_46_46_0.wav|in my spare time i like to watch movies i think over the past few years because of the situation that has caused us to stay home for a while i've tried my hardest to avoid crowds and people
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_46_46_1.wav|one of the best things you can do and kind of think about how things used to be before we had this change is watch movies
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_46_46_2.wav|i love a good film that makes you think about it after the movies over
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_46_46_3.wav|if i could i wish i could make a movie but the idea of making a movie hurts my head
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_46_46_4.wav|i think having a story to tell
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_46_46_5.wav|i think i have a story to tell but i don't have the budget cask
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_46_46_6.wav|and talent to edit an entire film
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_46_46_7.wav|if i had that i would be making short films every weekend and uploading them to youtube other than watching movies and daydreaming about being a director i also like to play video games
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_46_46_8.wav|however i know i have to get out more often as staying home all the time is going terrible for my midsection
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_46_46_9.wav|so maybe i should start exercising more
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_47_47_0.wav|i'd like to be a professor there are many reasons i chose to be a professor firstly
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_47_47_1.wav|i want to teach because i like the pace of the academic calendar
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_47_47_2.wav|too long vacations offer me an opportunity for reflection research and writing
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_47_47_3.wav|secondly i want to teach because i like the freedom to make my own mistakes to learn my own lesson and to stimulate myself and my students
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_47_47_4.wav|and i can have the opportunity to keep on learning
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_47_47_5.wav|finally i want to teach because being around students who are beginning to grow and change in front of me
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_47_47_6.wav|i will grow and change with them to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_47_47_7.wav|but teaching is no easy job at all i must
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_47_47_8.wav|study cleverly to obtain more knowledge and at the same time i will make every effort to purify my soul so that i can become an architect of mansoul
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_48_48_0.wav|if i could go back in time and choose a job i think i would reconsider my current career in order to become a marine biologist
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_48_48_1.wav|i think that would be an amazing way to work with animals and study sea life
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_48_48_2.wav|i think the seas are the most important thing on our planet right now they span over 75 of the planet

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_48_48_7.wav|also i'd like to be involved in the education of the general public in order to help them understand how to protect the seas

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_49_49_1.wav|comedies are very interesting and the story makes me happy and laugh i believe everyone goes through sad times when i'm sad i like to watch a comedy because it will help me forget my sadness and focus on the happy news that promise he brings

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_50_50_0.wav|if i had to pick one genre i would pick horror horror films can be surreal scary treats are low-budget trash i really enjoy both of those if i could give an example of two different movies that i would recommend this genre i would say hellraiser an example of a great horror film and mannose the kind the hands of fate as a shock garbage that is still fun to watch
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_50_50_1.wav|clive barker's hellraiser is such a fun trip through a world of people who are

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_50_50_4.wav|the hands of fate was made because a person who sold animal manure made a bet with a producer that he could make a movie for 5,000 dollars and it looks like it was shot and made for about 30 it's so bad it's a masterpiece

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_53_53_0.wav|i would like to learn drawing the most it is related to a lot of things in our daily life it can help improve the sense of beauty
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_53_53_1.wav|when we design clothes or architecture everything is based on drawing i think drawing is the the best of almost any form of art drawing allows one to express feelings and emotions that words can't describe
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_53_53_2.wav|when we want to concentrate on something drawing will be a pretty good skill that i can make
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_53_53_3.wav|that i can make my own idea into drawing
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_54_54_0.wav|i think most people would answer this by learning a fun skill that you can probably use in a hobby if i could learn a skill i would rather learn something more helpful
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_54_54_1.wav|i believe i would like to take a course in how to successfully perform first aid cpr and use the aed machine about 20 years ago i took a class however first aid and cpr training has changed so much in that time i've learned every six second is important during these times
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_54_54_2.wav|i think i it would be more valuable for me to be certified in first aid because i would be able to help people in my community my office when it's needed i just hope no one tries to sue me for trying to help
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_55_55_0.wav|well it's a really difficult question in my opinion making more money doesn't always mean you'll be happier at work if the job i chose has an okay salary
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_55_55_1.wav|and at the same time if i can get personal satisfaction that would be great however if it has a very low salary i believe it would be very hard for anyone
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_55_55_2.wav|but i might chose to choose to work a second job to support my job that can get personal action because i don't want to give up on the job that can get satisfaction
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_56_56_0.wav|money makes the world go round money is important without money you can't live
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_56_56_1.wav|but can you live with what you do if you hate it and just make a lot of money i truly believe the answer to that is no
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_56_56_2.wav|it's important to get paid but if you hate your job and you just look at your paycheck and hate your job your performance in that job will be low and others will see how much effort you actually put into your work
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_56_56_3.wav|i think it's much more rewarding to be in a job job that will allow you to be happy and make you believe that every time you walk in a work you're happy rather than just going in for a paycheck

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_63_63_0.wav|well the skill i'd probably teach to anyone is the basics of english language i have over seven years of experience teaching and i have learned that no two students are the same
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_63_63_1.wav|it's really important when you're learning english to first have a positive first lesson
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_63_63_2.wav|always try your best to make the first lesson simple if you can do that students will see that they're able to achieve it you can steadily start leveling them up until they get into simple sentences
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_63_63_3.wav|from there sky's the limit
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_63_63_4.wav|most people want to learn how to speak relational english that does take a while but if you can get the basics of the language you'll be well on your way
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_63_63_5.wav|i think i could teach these skills to people with ease which would allow them to communicate with more people from around the world
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_64_64_0.wav|i believe one skill i could teach others is about film editing i would first break down some of the common lingo in the field i would mention how to edit and maybe a little bit of the history of editing as it is super easy to do now compared to 10 years ago
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_64_64_1.wav|then i would actually so so show someone how to edit i think the key is all about timing you could be amazing at placing your edits but the most important thing is when and where you cut in order to masterfully and seamlessly make the action movie in your story
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_64_64_2.wav|editing is something that takes time to get just right but when you do it feels like your storytelling skills have increased tenfold
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_64_64_3.wav|editing is really rewarding because you can create the final product that people actually get to view and see
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_64_64_4.wav|i highly recommend trying to edit something of your own at is quite fun give it a shot sometime
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_65_65_0.wav|the best time of the year for me is when i get to volunteer at the buddhist temple it includes leading the way for serving as a guide for people who come to the buddhist temple

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_68_68_6.wav|if i could run my own haunted house i know it would be a challenging business to run but i think it would be fun and profitable to

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_70_70_1.wav|i moved to orlando florida for university and it was pretty excited because i saw a chance to become a scare actor and one of universal studios seasonal haunted houses
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_70_70_2.wav|i thought it would be a good
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_70_70_3.wav|i thought it would be a fun chance to try something different and be part of a theme park and try something exciting and it was so much fun i got to see how all the things work behind the scenes at these events i scared a ton of guests and was even able to meet people that shared my interest and i continue to be friends with more than a decade later if i had a time machine i know where i'd go back to in october of 2009 it was so much fun and so exciting
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_71_71_0.wav|i have had a lot of birthday parties but i think my favorite was when i was 25 my mom got me an amazing gift
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_71_71_1.wav|two tickets to see the eagles they may be a dated band but i dare you to tell me that hotel california is not one of the best songs

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_71_71_3.wav|i was so excited to go to the concert as i had heard their music for years and it was incredibly fun time as it was all outdoors
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_71_71_4.wav|the concert itself wasn't too crazy as to the fans that are in the bands are in their 60s their encore was hotel california they brought down the house and it was one of the best birthdays i've ever had
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_72_72_0.wav|it was my birthday and i was turning 13 i remember being in high school and i was called a front office it was about 12:00

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_72_72_4.wav|we went to the park together while on the next day and did everything my parents wanted to do it was an amazing birthday
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_73_73_0.wav|well emotion is one of the basic things that makes us human and anger is one of them
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_73_73_1.wav|i normally get angry when a speedy rash driving vehicle crosses me on road or someone with a high pitch modified exhaust system they just do it for fun not considering how they affect others
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_73_73_2.wav|for a few seconds i'm really tempered and will like to say it's so terrible i'm damn sick of these cars nobody can tolerate them nobody drives like this you should really listen to yourselves to hear how loud your car is
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_73_73_3.wav|i think getting angry is human nature and hard to control for me another example is when someone tells rumors about me or backstabbing will actually make me angry
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_74_74_0.wav|i think the thing that makes me angry is when someone is repeatedly late and always not on time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_74_74_1.wav|being repeatedly late is a sign of disrespect it's easy to make people feel angry and i think most people understand that being late is a sign of not respecting another person's time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_74_74_2.wav|it's okay to get angry at people who are always late and sometimes i know that i can't change other people's behaviors
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_74_74_3.wav|but what i can change is how i react to it
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_74_74_4.wav|sometimes you need to have a discussion with people saying
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_74_74_5.wav|if you're always going to be late i don't want to make plans with you anymore it says a clear boundary and states that you need to be treated fairly a good friend will understand and try to change a selfish friend will agree and still be late anyway
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_74_74_6.wav|however a codependent friend will attack you with
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_74_74_7.wav|unreasonable demands
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_75_75_0.wav|the most angry event in my childhood is that my dad planned to take me go to disneyland to have a fun time with him however on the day before he told me because of the overtime of work he cannot go with me he promised to me many many times that he will take me for my birthday celebration however it didn't come true i was pretty upset and what makes me angry about it is because it's not the only one time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_76_76_1.wav|the angriest i've ever been was went one of the school bullies decided to pick on me i was upset at him and i decided that i was going to fight him
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_76_76_2.wav|but since i didn't have any friends with me
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_76_76_3.wav|his friends pretty much beat me up ran over my hands with their bikes and strangled me wasn't a fun time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_76_76_4.wav|that was the last lawyer had scrapped i was ever in because it didn't solve anything the bully was still a mean person and harass many people in school
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_76_76_5.wav|the funniest thing about this was that later in life the bullies brother start an anti-bullying program i hope his brother decided to go through with it he was just so mean
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_76_76_6.wav|and also extremely hurtful for people from other cultures i never wish to see that man again
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_77_77_1.wav|one time i
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_77_77_2.wav|was at a public park and saw some young kids smoking cigarettes and generally being delinquents my first thought was
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_77_77_3.wav|how the heck these kids were getting their cigarettes like who in their right mind would say
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_77_77_4.wav|well i was a kid once and i smoke now i better be a good person and by these kids cigarettes
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_77_77_5.wav|i think this is a reason why in a society we have rules some rules don't make sense to follow but we follow them anyway
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_77_77_6.wav|but if you don't make the rules like don't give kids tobacco and clearly show why we couldn't do such things and have an appropriate punishment for why you shouldn't people will still do it because they don't have common sense
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_78_78_0.wav|i don't know how people raise children it's not my place to tell others how or how not to raise a kid
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_78_78_1.wav|but your child openly picks on a child that is weaker or has physical or mental disabilities i will probably think less of you and your offspring
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_78_78_2.wav|case in point
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_78_78_3.wav|i was walking in the mall and there were a group of kids harassing this obviously challenged individual why were they doing it because they could
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_78_78_4.wav|if i was their teacher i put them in detention for the rest of their primary school days and wouldn't let them out until the understood why that they were terminating a human that has emotions and feelings
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_78_78_5.wav|but alas i'm not their teacher i don't find it nice to treat people awful and these kids deserve to learn a lesson on how to treat others
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_79_79_0.wav|when i first started living on my own i didn't have a job that provided a high salary to make ends meet i would do overtime work and i was at the same time studying for my certification exam
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_79_79_1.wav|however in the room above there is a family and i swear that every single night they had a party it was like they were constantly playing with bowling balls down the middle of either room
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_79_79_2.wav|every night there was a fight every night something smashed on the ground
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_79_79_3.wav|about a week before my certification exam i couldn't stand it anymore and decided going to do something about it
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_79_79_4.wav|so i went up to the door and politely complain to them about the issue they just kind of
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_79_79_6.wav|me and took the door in my face
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_79_79_7.wav|i promised myself as soon as i get enough money i'm getting the heck out of this place and someone else can deal with these problems
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_80_80_0.wav|one time i had to set up the internet on a property that was owned by my parents
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_80_80_1.wav|this should be have been an easy 20 minute process all i had to do is tell the company and say to turn on the internet and then the process would be done
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_80_80_2.wav|my father neglected to tell me that there is a username needed

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_80_80_6.wav|but the username was hidden in the house oh and he had stock in the company that he was using so there were user numbers that didn't actually do anything

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_81_81_2.wav|she said that her son's exams were going on and that's why she needs money to spend on him
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_81_81_3.wav|she and her husband are working hard to keep the roof above their head i was impressed
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_81_81_4.wav|so i told her

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_81_81_6.wav|and i asked her if she needs any other help she said she was worried about her son poor guy was very stressed he was working really hard to get in a reputed engineering college she was really depressed because last year due to a bad ranked her elder son didn't make into a good college and they did not have enough money to support him
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_81_81_7.wav|reservation killed her dreams in all hope for a bright future

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_82_82_7.wav|on our way to the next attraction we chatted with each other for a long time and the worst thing was that the signal of our cell phones were not very good and we could not connect to the map we were so worried and did not know what to do there were hardly any people on a quiet street we got to keep on walking

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_96_96_4.wav|it was a plan that they had made for me under a lot of chaos with my mother

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_96_96_8.wav|i never expected this from them i was completely speechless
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_97_97_0.wav|i remember a time that i was surprised to meet my friends accidentally at the time i lived in osaka i went to shinsaibashi i had never been there before
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_97_97_1.wav|but there was an area called a medical buddha and i figured i'm american i'll check it out
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_97_97_2.wav|i decided to eat a restaurant there and was surprised when i was waiting to get into the restaurant i saw my friend kim walking into the restaurant it was such a coincidence to see her at the restaurant to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_97_97_3.wav|and i talked with her for a little while when i saw her
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_97_97_4.wav|also on the same day when i was walking back to the station and on the way back i met another friend i couldn't believe it i saw two friends on the same day accidentally
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_97_97_5.wav|i was pretty surprised and maybe it is a small world
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_98_98_0.wav|one time i was traveling to walt disney world it's about three hours away from where i used to live we went to the main park the magic kingdom
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_98_98_1.wav|when we walked in we saw that my friend who lived down the street was there
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_98_98_2.wav|on the exact same day and time we were pretty surprised that we were there also far away from home but at the same place
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_98_98_3.wav|we decided to ride
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_98_98_4.wav|to write or two together and when we separated as we were on our own families and decided to allow each other for family time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_98_98_5.wav|however that night we all got together
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_98_98_6.wav|and had a huge dinner together because we all happen to be there i guess when there are only so many places that you can be sometimes you'll run into people that you know
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_99_99_0.wav|one time here
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_99_99_1.wav|one time i was out with my friends a bit late into the evening we found ourselves getting onto the final train for the evening he was about midnight and realistically not that late
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_99_99_2.wav|back when i lived in america i recalled staying out until maybe about two or three in the morning enjoying the nightlife
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_99_99_3.wav|however i enjoy that i learned i quickly learned that japan was quite two different
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_99_99_4.wav|since there is public transport more people find it easier to have that last drink before heading out on the final train
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_99_99_5.wav|you can really tell
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_99_99_6.wav|as it seemed all of these black people in suits
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_99_99_7.wav|no as it seems all of these people in black suits and ties were shuffling aboard the train
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_99_99_8.wav|it was like being a zombie movie where all the zombies were extremely well dressed
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_99_99_9.wav|as the train went down the track you can see everyone shift in turn you really have to think to yourself
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_99_99_10.wav|how could this meet many people we'll get drunk all at the same time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_9_9_0.wav|in my opinion making more money doesn't always mean you'll be happier at work i think that job satisfaction is more important as has more meaning than pursuing a job that has a high salary
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_9_9_1.wav|i think the reason for happiness and satisfaction is not how much money you make but whether you really want to do the job
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_9_9_2.wav|i think people can turn a hobby into their own job if you can't do it now just keep looking for it
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_9_9_3.wav|search until you find a job that is really suitable for you
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_9_9_4.wav|then when thinking about the future is really important to be happy in your personal life
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_9_9_5.wav|and that should never be based on the amount of money or quantity of money that you will receive
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_9_9_6.wav|because if you're happy and satisfied with your job then you'll be satisfied when you look for other things around you
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_0_9_9_7.wav|after all salary comes once a month but job satisfaction user whole career every minute of your day
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_2.wav|so sunscreen sunscreen is probably the best thing that you can use regardless if you're a woman regardless if you're a man i think men should use sunscreen i think in japan using sunscreen is very popular
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_3.wav|so sunscreen is very good here but you go to a place like the united states you go to places like los angeles
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_4.wav|men will not want to use sunscreen
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_5.wav|but they will want to go tanning
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_6.wav|but suntan suntanned is sun-damaged i don't think they realize it suntanning is your skin
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_7.wav|getting damaged and the darkening is because it's like a it's a response
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_8.wav|so suntanning is not is not very good and then 20 years later
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_9.wav|it becomes a surprise it becomes such a shock when the same people realize they have cancer
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_10.wav|so it is a very interesting way of thinking when i was in los angeles i had friends that would go tanning
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_11.wav|but they don't understand that in 20 years if they want to look good that is not a good practice
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_13.wav|yeah but at this at the same time that is
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_14.wav|what gives me a job
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_15.wav|they want to look good and i want to help them look good
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_16.wav|but i want to make sure when i
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_17.wav|when i develop products that it actually helps your skin
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_18.wav|does not cover up does not make you look
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_19.wav|better but actually makes the cells function better
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_20.wav|makes your skin
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_22.wav|there are ways that you can measure your age in any tissue your brain you can measure how old your brain is your skin is your blood that exists
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_23.wav|it's crazy
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_24.wav|it's almost something from the future but you give sample of
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_25.wav|can sample or blood sample
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_26.wav|very very non-invasive usually it's blood
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_27.wav|but you can measure how
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_28.wav|something is so say that i'm 30
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_29.wav|if i took a small skin sample and did this test
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_31.wav|the age would not be 30 i think i have very good skincare
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_32.wav|so maybe my age my skin age is
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_33.wav|25 don't know
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_34.wav|but maybe is younger
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_35.wav|i have not tried
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_37.wav|right so that but that's because i study it maybe my brain is not so young i
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_38.wav|am very stressed out maybe my brain has aged more
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_39.wav|but these tests exist yeah
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_40.wav|but these tests exists that you can measure your age for different tissue
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_42.wav|i think that is a good first step into helping people be more mindful about living longer
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_43.wav|unfortunately though these tests are expensive so who can afford it
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_44.wav|the rich people
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_45.wav|and sometimes rich people don't care

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_57.wav|make cells younger
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_58.wav|yeah yeah so it sounds like something
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_59.wav|out of a science fiction novel how can you make your cells younger to make yourself younger
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_60.wav|but that's exactly what is happening and you can do that there are cells
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_61.wav|so this is crazy
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_62.wav|so for me i give you an example
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_63.wav|i'll give you an example so the sun the sun will shine on your face
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_64.wav|and it will penetrate to damage dna
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_65.wav|your the basic
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_66.wav|information of yourself
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_67.wav|yeah so that that is yes and it mmm to the dna molecule and damage it
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_69.wav|and enough of that will cause mutations
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_70.wav|and will mess with the function of the skin
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_71.wav|that can cause wrinkles
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_73.wav|but depending on how much damage it also can turn this miles into
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_74.wav|zombie cells
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_75.wav|where they will be inflammation like a zombie they are mutated
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_76.wav|but they are mutated and start attacking the healthy cells
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_77.wav|cause inflammation causes wrinkles can cause cancer
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_78.wav|they are not there they're not dead they're not dead so this is a very new topic in the field it's called senescence
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_79.wav|this is a more precise topic
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_81.wav|and i they're very
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_82.wav|yeah essien send esc
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_87.wav|the cells don't die they do not die
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_88.wav|that's all on yes that if you see that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_89.wav|so these cells
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_90.wav|they don't die
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_91.wav|they are not they don't die so in the skin the skin has actually a lot of senescent these zombie cells
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_92.wav|because of the way your skin is exposed to the sun too exposed to ultraviolet light
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_93.wav|but with with the senescent cells since they're zombies they start attacking other healthy tissue the cells inside causing inflammation
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_94.wav|causing cancer causing
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_95.wav|a lot of damage destruction
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_96.wav|my work is trying to identify how can our body
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_97.wav|our skin fight
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_98.wav|to destroy these cells
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_99.wav|how can i kill how can i kill the zombie cells in our skin
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_106.wav|the mechanism for how it happens is not well studied
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_107.wav|but for me i'm more interested on what can i do to help
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_108.wav|kill the zombies how can i prevent zombies
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_109.wav|from attacking healthy cells because it's been shown that these zombie cells cause skin aging
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_110.wav|so if we have the zombie cells and we can stop them from causing skin aging that is a product
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_111.wav|that will combine the science and help prevent aging that will treat aging the one of the causes of aging and that's where i feel my skill is a very good fit
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_113.wav|so it's cosmetics but hmm
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_115.wav|yes yeah so outside of making your cells younger which is what other scientists do
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_116.wav|i'm more about how can we use our natural health
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_117.wav|to eliminate zombie cells
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_118.wav|from your skin and perhaps many other areas of your body
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_119.wav|so before damage before damage
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_120.wav|maybe maybe so before the damage where you can like make the damage
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_121.wav|before the cells are old
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_122.wav|how can you make them younger before any of that how can you prevent damage
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_123.wav|to make healthy living longer
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_124.wav|and that that is
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_125.wav|what i'm working on
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_126.wav|and that's why i'm here in tokyo in japan
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_129.wav|yeah so sometimes when i explain
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_130.wav|so maybe i will be on tv
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_131.wav|i will bob be on tv for sports but maybe for more for my science discovery
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_132.wav|that that is something that i think it will help me feel successful it
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_133.wav|will help me
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_134.wav|man it just it's so much worse
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_135.wav|so much work so it's so much work
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_136.wav|then looks like
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_138.wav|i'm yeah i i'm doing i can do my i will do my best but you understand the impact
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_139.wav|so with this big impact it's just it is important it i think it is work that is worth doing
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_140.wav|so if jeff jeff bezos can give me money
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_142.wav|he can he can
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_143.wav|it's too much money
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_144.wav|too much money he has so much money
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_145.wav|yes please yes if you if you can talk to him talk to him and bill gates
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_146.wav|elon musk
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_147.wav|all of them to tell to i can help them make them look nice
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_148.wav|anyway yeah that's actually what i've been up to when i'm not it in when i'm not you know here that's my lab work
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_10_10_150.wav|that's my research
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_0.wav|so i believe with the statement
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_2.wav|you should take your time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_3.wav|to get to where you need to go
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_4.wav|instead of hurry
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_5.wav|do all your work after and rest i think you should take your time take as much rest as possible and continue you have to be perseverant
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_6.wav|rather than rushed if you want to do a good job
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_7.wav|i learned this through many ways
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_8.wav|i learned this as a graduate student
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_9.wav|i am sure that you can understand
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_10.wav|that if you hurry yeah
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_11.wav|if you hurry right you can make mistakes and you will have to redo the work and it's more time but if you take your time and be
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_12.wav|very thorough
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_13.wav|it is easier
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_14.wav|in the long time the long term of time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_23.wav|i learned i learned the hard way that if you are hurried and hurried and hurried you will spend more time fixing mistakes you did in the first place
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_24.wav|i learned way too many times i learned the hard way as they say i learned the hard way that i work much better personally
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_25.wav|i work much better
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_26.wav|when i go at my own pace
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_27.wav|i am careful
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_28.wav|because i want to do a good job
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_29.wav|i go at my own pace and i do a good job
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_30.wav|that way i don't have to repeat it
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_31.wav|again and again and again i do it once and i do it well
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_32.wav|that also helps me relax after because i know i did a good job if i'm very nervous about being
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_33.wav|wrong always making a mistake i cannot rest so even if i'm done fast the rest is not actual rest it's me worrying
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_34.wav|did i do this right do i need to redo it do i need a plan and it makes me too nervous
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_35.wav|and i don't have a relaxing time it's always going to be stress
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_36.wav|so for me rushing and stress or the same
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_39.wav|very that is a very good question
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_40.wav|yes so when you are a team it is a lot more complicated because you want to stay on the same pace as the team right
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_41.wav|i make it yeah i make it very clear that i will give updates
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_42.wav|as appropriately as
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_43.wav|possible i try to maintain the communication that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_44.wav|i am doing this i am doing this i am doing this if i have a list of five things i will do numbers 1 and number 2
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_45.wav|and then i will do number three number four number five it will not always do numbers 1 2 3 4
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_46.wav|5 so i communicate i think i have maybe
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_48.wav|makes me sound very
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_49.wav|it's independent but also makes me sound very aggressive
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_50.wav|i just try to let them know i want to do a good job we are on the same
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_51.wav|we want to work well both of us i'm not the enemy
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_52.wav|i'm not trying to i'm not trying to sabotage
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_53.wav|by working at a different time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_54.wav|i just cannot work at the same rate that is go go go go go because i know that is not my best work
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_55.wav|would you rather not have me have best good good work or fast work good work or fast work is a choice
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_56.wav|so i think for any manager good work
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_57.wav|they prefer good work then fast work
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_58.wav|that is my that is my opinion
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_59.wav|yeah it depends on the manager
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_60.wav|if i were a manager i would want good work not fast work
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_62.wav|yeah yeah so i still will
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_63.wav|receive feedback
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_64.wav|if i need to hurry if i need to slow down
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_65.wav|but i yes but i will know i will still maintain my own
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_67.wav|if i know that it will severely affect other people then yes maybe i will go a little faster but i still won't i won't do that every single time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_68.wav|so working a team i think can be a little complicated when you have someone
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_70.wav|either is too slow or too fast i think i do a good job i think i do a good job about adapting
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_71.wav|but even then i won't go too slow or too fast i want to stay somewhere in between
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_72.wav|where it is not
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_73.wav|so stressful because
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_75.wav|sorry but sometimes work work is not my life
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_76.wav|i like to have my adventures i like to have my adventures i like to have my
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_78.wav|like my dodgeball so yes i think you understand for me i have other
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_79.wav|ways to enjoy life
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_80.wav|work isn't always my life and that may be a very controversial statement
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_81.wav|some people think work should be everything everything but
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_82.wav|for me that is does just too much stress
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_83.wav|i won't live so long if i'm very stressed out as we're discussing yeah and
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_84.wav|i actually actually
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_85.wav|i have found in my experience
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_86.wav|so when i arrived here i was working working working working very hard japanese work very much i respect that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_87.wav|i worked better when i took a vacation i went to olson
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_88.wav|i went to kusatsu onsen you
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_89.wav|should go if you have not gone kusatsu onsen yeah
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_92.wav|worked much better after when i came back from kusatsu onsen i worked so much better
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_93.wav|after having my rest
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_94.wav|after taking my time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_95.wav|my productivity was increased after i take my rest
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_99.wav|i need to enjoy
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_100.wav|and i and almost every vacation i take now is onsen style
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_109.wav|i will take my vacation normal days
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_110.wav|yeah so normally i you know i will sacrifice maybe a weekend
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_111.wav|so i think i told you i had lab meeting on monday
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_113.wav|but sunday i worked
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_114.wav|oh no my ear pods the are pods
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_116.wav|i don't know if one of the air pods is out of battery can i pause or should i keep recording keep
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_117.wav|recording i think both of the air pods are reaching zero percent
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_11_11_119.wav|okay stop right now and i will give you two numbers for this next conversation okay i will stop
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_0.wav|so i've personally found that i work a lot better when i've had time to rest when i take my time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_1.wav|usually take my time to rest and live life at my pace which is
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_2.wav|maybe a slower pace
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_4.wav|typical society that is go-go-go that is known to be very productive i think
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_5.wav|i can still be very productive
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_6.wav|just have a maybe a bit more more of
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_7.wav|an adaptive you that i recognize when i need to rest i recognize when i need to slow down
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_8.wav|conserve energy before it ends up
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_9.wav|making me sick making me not feel well
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_11.wav|i need to take a break or else my health will be bad
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_12.wav|so when this usually happens i've always gone to an onsen i've always
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_13.wav|taken a day off
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_14.wav|so for example outside of my dodgeball
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_15.wav|i'm taking the day off tomorrow my boss knows this i'm taking a day off tomorrow to go sakura hunting
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_16.wav|to look at the sakura blossoms
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_17.wav|so maybe i'm going to chidori
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_19.wav|and go on a boat
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_20.wav|and then enjoy
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_21.wav|the cherry blossoms
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_22.wav|because most of the time of my week i'm in the lab and the lab is not very pretty
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_23.wav|can be very lonely very quiet
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_24.wav|and even if i'm outside by myself
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_25.wav|i still am enjoying
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_26.wav|being a new place
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_27.wav|so having outside time being by myself but in doing
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_28.wav|something i enjoy is very important for my rest important for my mental and productivity work
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_30.wav|very strongly about going at your pace
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_31.wav|if i were a manager i would
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_32.wav|suggest to many of my
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_34.wav|go at your own pace
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_35.wav|that can sometimes be exploited i think people may take advantage of that if i don't care about their timeline
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_36.wav|they will not work they will be lazy
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_37.wav|it will have to be a process to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_40.wav|if i am in a position supervisor position to teach how to be
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_41.wav|lazy but productive
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_42.wav|maybe those two words are very contradicting
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_43.wav|but lazy where you can rest and then productive
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_44.wav|because you are passionate and you want success
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_45.wav|so i think people balls either choose one or the other
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_46.wav|maybe sometimes is out of their control
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_48.wav|my best to control both at the same level
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_49.wav|i think also from a health perspective stress is a very big issue i think stress may cause a lot of the very
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_50.wav|serious health problems in this day and age
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_51.wav|stress can lead to heart problems stress can lead to high blood pressure
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_52.wav|stress can lead to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_54.wav|body may be
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_55.wav|over producing
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_56.wav|certain molecules that can cause inflammation
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_57.wav|it's a little
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_58.wav|interesting to think about how stress is psychological
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_59.wav|but still has a physiological abadi effects
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_60.wav|so it's also goes to show you how your feelings
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_61.wav|affect your physical health as well i think all of those are connected
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_63.wav|the funny thing is
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_64.wav|if you ask this question two different ages of people whether they are younger maybe below 30
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_65.wav|in their 30s over 30 maybe a different generation maybe letter more 80s 90s older older people
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_66.wav|you may get a
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_67.wav|different set of answers
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_68.wav|because i think values whether it's from that time or personal values of who they are will influence
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_69.wav|the debate of this question
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_70.wav|so i know that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_71.wav|my father he would say work work work work work than rest
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_72.wav|like work work work work than retire
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_73.wav|except now that he is retired he doesn't know what to do
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_74.wav|he's always stressed about doing nothing
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_75.wav|because he never had time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_76.wav|to do nothing he never gave himself time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_78.wav|sit to just sit still
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_79.wav|so i think he has out of practice and actually has been asking me
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_80.wav|as i work work work what i have been doing to to relax
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_81.wav|and i tell him i go to the park i
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_82.wav|have been cooking more my dad does not cook so maybe that is something i can help him learn
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_83.wav|i also hope that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_84.wav|when now that he is retired
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_85.wav|we can go and share some adventures he always wanted to go hiking at a food some
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_87.wav|i told him that is something that he can practice he can
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_89.wav|a few miles in some of the hills close to home
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_90.wav|the area by san francisco has many hills so he can practice
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_91.wav|so that when he can visit me we can hike fuji song
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_93.wav|very interesting how he
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_94.wav|has lived his life and now how i'm living my life
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_95.wav|and how we're sharing advice
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_96.wav|the other day now that he's retired he says don't push yourself i think because he understands that health
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_97.wav|over the long term is so important and that if you're stressed
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_98.wav|if you don't take care of yourself that also has negative consequences
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_100.wav|i think if my father was answering this question when he was younger he would he would say the opposite i'm almost sure
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_101.wav|on my mom maybe my mom maybe
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_102.wav|will be the same answer i think she is understood because she also worked but maybe not to the same level as my dad she understood that she needed to rest
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_103.wav|mainly because her health isn't as strong she
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_104.wav|always needed to take into consideration your health
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_105.wav|to make sure she was healthy to make sure she had the strength
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_106.wav|mental physical to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_107.wav|to do good work so for her pacing was very important because then she would have
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_108.wav|to go to the hospital if she got a little bit
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_109.wav|overwhelmed or carried away and that also it was very scary when i was growing up there were certain cases where
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_110.wav|we were very worried
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_111.wav|as a family
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_112.wav|and i mean you
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_113.wav|hear about this in the news that people
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_114.wav|become so stressed that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_115.wav|it can be a very serious issue
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_117.wav|people will pass away they will choose to pass away instead of
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_119.wav|responsible for their actions
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_121.wav|think that then also sometimes supports the idea of
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_123.wav|understanding of the times when people need to switch
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_125.wav|working working working fast going fast going fast
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_126.wav|to one that where you go so slow so that you have this mix of
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_127.wav|fast fast fast fast slow
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_128.wav|as a team i think
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_129.wav|as a teammate or as a supervisor that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_130.wav|that's probably one of the best solutions i can offer
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_131.wav|if you're ever in a situation that makes you question
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_132.wav|your purpose
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_133.wav|so that is
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_134.wav|in your control
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_135.wav|it is a scary thing taking a control of your time whether you use your time solely for work always work
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_136.wav|always for
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_137.wav|being busy
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_138.wav|that it does take practice
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_139.wav|because sometimes if you're not busy you feel guilty and i'm certainly the same way but i'm slowly starting to learn
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_141.wav|take that rest
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_142.wav|i shouldn't be guilty for putting with my health forward that is that is the basic
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_143.wav|type of care that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_144.wav|a person needs a human being needs
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_145.wav|and that that is
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_146.wav|something that i have
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_147.wav|gotten help with
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_148.wav|with my friends
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_149.wav|but now that i'm abroad can be a little bit difficult so what i have done also for accountability when i tell myself
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_150.wav|rest is productive is
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_151.wav|taking pictures and sharing them with my family and my friends and i say look
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_152.wav|this is what i've done i am happy
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_153.wav|i'm happy that i rested
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_154.wav|and i'm happy that i can wake up tomorrow and continue working and doing good work
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_155.wav|because of the way that i am controlling my time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_156.wav|i think it couldn't being able to control your time is a very important concept i think it's a very important skill
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_158.wav|context of this though can be quite difficult because some people think controlling your time can be selfish
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_159.wav|it is selfish but maybe not in the negative sense i think
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_160.wav|it can be quite positive it can be actually very empowering not everybody is encouraged to take their time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_161.wav|for themselves
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_163.wav|want to encourage people that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_164.wav|when you do time is not promised right
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_165.wav|we all think that were invisible we all think maybe we might live
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_167.wav|but you don't
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_168.wav|know until maybe there's a problem
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_169.wav|if you have enough time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_171.wav|optimizing when you can go fast when you can go slow
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_172.wav|i think is a very
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_173.wav|useful skill that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_174.wav|isn't taught
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_175.wav|that maybe people practice or don't practice as much as they should
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_176.wav|but it's been important for me as i am now learning more about myself being abroad
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_177.wav|that i need to i need to focus on and i think over the last two years people are realizing health all of a sudden can be
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_178.wav|you cannot have health
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_179.wav|so maximizing time with family things that make you happy sometimes work may not make you happy that's a reality for some people
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_180.wav|recognizing what makes you happy and to see your energy there so that you can get energy back
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_181.wav|is more productive than directing your energy towards something that always takes and takes and takes but does not give back that is how you get burned out
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_182.wav|that is how you start
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_183.wav|not believing in a big purpose
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_184.wav|and one of
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_185.wav|the lessons that i want to encourage people is
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_186.wav|to do the opposite even if it takes some time it may be a day to yourself and maybe an hour to yourself taking a break
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_187.wav|is always just so important and i
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_189.wav|now that the world is going back to normal taking breaks should be should be
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_12_12_192.wav|that's the sign of someone that cares for you and your health
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_2.wav|are a few cities that i know mainly because i've lived there
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_3.wav|i know san francisco i know los angeles because i lived in california until i came
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_4.wav|to japan
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_5.wav|so san francisco is a very popular city
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_6.wav|it was
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_7.wav|always very beautiful because it's next to the ocean
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_8.wav|and since it also has a lot of tourists
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_9.wav|so i went to college in san francisco and sometimes after college i would go to restaurants with friends
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_10.wav|i would go to golden gate bridge with friends i would
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_11.wav|just explore san francisco either by walking or by taking the train sometimes if my friend had a car i would we would also explore that way
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_12.wav|and then after san francisco i lived in los angeles
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_13.wav|office angeles is also a very big city you
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_14.wav|cannot walk to explore to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_17.wav|most of los angeles you need to have a car but that also means traffic
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_18.wav|so that was also very difficult but one thing i enjoyed was
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_19.wav|taking my bicycle and going down santa monica pier which is a beach area and next to the beach all the way way from top of los angeles to bottom of los angeles only in bicycle
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_20.wav|and now i am here in tokyo which is even bigger city than san francisco and los angeles
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_21.wav|but is very accessible with trains very accessible with bikes various forcible with
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_22.wav|with walking so i think for me i like many city area
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_23.wav|i don't know if i like small city
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_24.wav|maybe the small town maybe for visiting i can take a shinkansen or i can drive small city but i don't not to live in
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_25.wav|small village area
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_27.wav|want to maybe visit more cities
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_28.wav|i'm very interested in european cities
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_29.wav|so when you think of european
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_30.wav|madrid barcelona in spain london in england
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_31.wav|paris in france i've been to paris i went to paris i did not like it
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_32.wav|yeah i went to paris spent time as tourist in paris but i did not i did not like it
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_35.wav|just too too popular to too
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_36.wav|many tourists
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_1_1_37.wav|yeah so yeah so actually i went to the part of france

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_2_2_107.wav|but mixing passion fruit that is acid very acidic

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_2_2_109.wav|with strawberry which is also acidic but in like a
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_2_2_110.wav|i think they added some some some jelly

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_2_2_135.wav|it's like when people it's almost when people compare tokyo with like osaka
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_2_2_136.wav|tokyo with osaka tokyo with i don't know sakamoto maybe
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_2_2_140.wav|i enjoy taco but i think for my personality kansai

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_2_2_156.wav|kobe kobe was where it opened

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_66.wav|and some sports i found were soccer so football
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_67.wav|not american style just
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_69.wav|tennis tennis was another one
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_71.wav|probably more baseball is very popular and none of those were very interesting for me
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_75.wav|there is dodgeball in japan
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_77.wav|the funny thing is
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_78.wav|the person that organizes the tokyo dodgeball
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_79.wav|also played in los angeles
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_80.wav|so same same kind of dodgeball
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_81.wav|from los angeles and now in tokyo
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_83.wav|so we go yeah yeah
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_84.wav|right right right so sometimes
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_85.wav|depending on what day we play sometimes it is at elementary school gym like basketball gym
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_86.wav|sometimes is on like a soccer court
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_87.wav|sometimes who this
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_88.wav|and the next month
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_90.wav|you know me as she thought park
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_91.wav|and xi shi ouya
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_92.wav|you know the top of shibuya has a court
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_93.wav|we play dodgeball there
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_94.wav|we played dodgeball there sometimes yeah
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_95.wav|yes but we still play dodgeball and it's my favorite kind to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_97.wav|no no i don't think so
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_98.wav|yes so i think also the sand makes it safe because if you are on a playground if you move maybe you can hurt yourself if you fall too hard sand sand is not so powerful
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_101.wav|yeah so i'm very surprised because i realized being in los angeles next to the beach we never played
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_102.wav|never played on beach dodgeball
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_103.wav|so i don't know why that is not common
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_104.wav|but anyway i played dodgeball
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_105.wav|i had to stop for 2 years because of code oh no virus but i've been playing dodgeball since i arrived in tokyo since i was in los angeles
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_106.wav|oh shoot what is today
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_107.wav|today is tuesday
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_110.wav|yeah tomorrow i'm playing dodgeball and
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_112.wav|so tomorrow so tomorrow at the playground is elementary school basketball gym
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_115.wav|middle school middle schools
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_118.wav|yes yes so he has he has to organize by having enough interest having people that live in these areas
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_119.wav|like shibuya ikebukuro
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_121.wav|and he has to make proposal to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_122.wav|school board or city board to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_125.wav|and also pay
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_126.wav|request payment from us the players
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_127.wav|to then give some of payment to the school for
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_128.wav|using facility
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_129.wav|it's not it's not free it's not free so we have to rent
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_132.wav|now what not everyone uses not everyone uses that i don't use i don't use
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_134.wav|exercise clothing
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_135.wav|is is normally what anybody can wear
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_137.wav|sometimes if people forget to bring
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_138.wav|uniform they will play in work clothing
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_141.wav|sometimes emergency like a suit like salaryman suits
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_143.wav|no um tight yes maybe maybe like like legs yeah maybe like like like leggings these kinds of fabric
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_144.wav|yeah something that is easy for moving you need to have movement
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_145.wav|with dodgeball even though sometimes you are focused on
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_146.wav|your surroundings
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_147.wav|it is also very important to move in different directions
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_148.wav|so for example
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_149.wav|you can move forward
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_150.wav|but stop and then move to dodgeball so you have to be very very good at
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_152.wav|sudden movement in anyway
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_153.wav|so i think because of the
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_154.wav|nature of this
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_3_3_155.wav|exercise this sport is also why i
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_1.wav|and it is very important for me
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_2.wav|i don't know maybe in the future to continue this if possible
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_3.wav|but at the very least i'm enjoying my my exercise now so when i am stressed out when i have a lot of work
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_4.wav|when i have to prepare data read papers i i always make time
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_5.wav|is it is rule for me i make time to play dodgeball as a
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_9.wav|yeah that's true so one of the
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_10.wav|one of the big goals for many and dodgeball community is making it a like olympic sport
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_11.wav|because you have volleyball
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_13.wav|have soccer basic very popular sports but no dodgeball at that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_14.wav|very competitive level
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_18.wav|know very good players
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_19.wav|and they want to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_20.wav|get want to have more dodgeball competition
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_21.wav|but that's so serious yeah yeah but that's so serious
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_22.wav|i played because i like to have fun
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_23.wav|so the funny thing the funny thing is that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_24.wav|in 2028 do you know where the olympics will be
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_25.wav|los angeles

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_43.wav|well maybe because if you get very good you get to travel
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_44.wav|all over the world so i know for example if many good players they go to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_45.wav|mexico i think canada where's

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_92.wav|like super bowl
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_93.wav|or world cup
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_4_4_96.wav|it's a mix i do not follow american style football but super bowl is also very popular for not know sport people like me

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_106.wav|and then i mean i am trying to play more yeah
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_107.wav|i'm trying to maybe play more as an adult actually
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_109.wav|my friend helped me

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_112.wav|to to not only help with my data analysis but it can also play video games so as a very good
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_113.wav|graphics card has memory processor has all of that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_114.wav|yeah all of that all of that so i think it's let's see
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_116.wav|three years old so still very new still very powerful
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_117.wav|i wanted to upgrade i wanted to i wanted to upgrade graphics i wanted to upgrade graphics card but right now is not very good
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_118.wav|no because i want just better i want better graphics card but if maybe
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_119.wav|yeah so i wanted to but right now graphics card are very or too expensive
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_120.wav|maybe okay i have to check i wasn't actively
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_121.wav|yeah and i think another thing is i wanted to upgrade my processor but with bitcoin mining and cryptocurrency that also has gotten very expensive
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_122.wav|so i have to no no
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_123.wav|no i'm saying i want it to be cheaper because everyone else using for mining
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_124.wav|and it's just annoying it's so annoying
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_125.wav|but if i were to play if i were to play now is adult the games i armoire
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_127.wav|puzzle puzzle type game
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_129.wav|i know i know that's why my friend says don't worry don't get upgrade but i want upgrade
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_130.wav|it's also true yeah so
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_131.wav|that is one thing sometimes i want to play i have
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_132.wav|video games but i
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_133.wav|get back from lab
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_134.wav|and i'm so tired and i just go sleep
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_136.wav|cook i have to do laundry i have to clean so sometimes playing video games is low low low priority
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_139.wav|me also when i
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_140.wav|data analysis i understand

DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_5_5_146.wav|for video game
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_1.wav|not not like that type but ones that just are a little bit more
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_2.wav|complicated maybe
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_3.wav|so one that i really need to try more and i really want to play more because it won awards haiti's
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_4.wav|so many people so many of my friends have told me i need to play hades
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_5.wav|do you know that yeah
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_7.wav|h ades hades action
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_8.wav|but not not always strategy has a mix it has a mix of all of those
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_9.wav|but many of my friends recommended hades because it has it
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_11.wav|very cool story line very cool characters
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_12.wav|but also is not impossible so i know many friends right now are playing elden ring bells ring is impossible to play
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_14.wav|as possible really
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_22.wav|no i don't want i want a fun game i can't do game that makes me mad
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_29.wav|no that's too complicated if if
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_30.wav|i play video games even when i was a kid for me playing video games as a way to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_33.wav|too high action video games makes me nervous too nervous oh
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_35.wav|so for example you know like call of duty the call of duty games
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_36.wav|action game no no no that makes me
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_37.wav|too many too much action you're always shooting at each other and you want to win and winning makes me stressful
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_38.wav|but i don't want to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_39.wav|know i just want to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_40.wav|know well yes no i don't want that but also just
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_42.wav|too much too much action
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_44.wav|me feel overwhelmed
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_46.wav|prefer calm game at my own pace
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_47.wav|but still enjoy
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_53.wav|did not play
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_54.wav|yeah i don't play it very much but i know
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_55.wav|some people that play it very relaxed
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_56.wav|and they complete complete yeah
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_58.wav|know other friends that they always are
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_59.wav|making crime and making a big mess so i think it depends it depends on personality
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_60.wav|when you play video games and also what games you like how is personality
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_61.wav|do you like
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_62.wav|high stimulation or do you like low stimulation i think i'm more low stimulation because normally normally i'm always busy normally always busy normally always busy i don't want more and more
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_66.wav|away vr games hmm i don't know too
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_67.wav|many vr games
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_70.wav|i don't think i don't think i can do that no
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_71.wav|when i place
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_72.wav|no i can't do that i don't think i can do that if i go to arcade for example
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_73.wav|i like to play space invaders i like to play
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_74.wav|yeah space invaders is good one for me
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_75.wav|tekken like fighting games maybe old games because new games in arcades
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_77.wav|get my attention
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_79.wav|old games because it reminds me of when i was kid i did not have to worry about problems
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_80.wav|i did not have to worry about adult
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_82.wav|yeah like nostalgic yes for me
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_83.wav|install jake yeah
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_84.wav|that's the one
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_85.wav|yeah i know that so the truth is i'm very bad at rhythm games
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_86.wav|so the dance dance revolution were you have
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_87.wav|the arrows right
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_88.wav|i'm very bad at i
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_89.wav|cannot it's too hard it's too hard but then you also have the hand games
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_90.wav|that are japanese style like the title station i cannot do
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_91.wav|i like but i'm not good at it
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_92.wav|cool drum master do you know that one with a drum the taiko drum
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_93.wav|that is fun to play but i'm not very good
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_94.wav|so something about rhythm
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_95.wav|it's fun to play with others yeah so
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_96.wav|i think i think i think for me because i grew up playing with my brother or i grew up playing with a friend
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_97.wav|video games for me need to have a communities playing by myself is not as exciting
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_98.wav|i think that's also why certain sports
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_99.wav|games for me have more need more community
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_100.wav|sometimes being by yourself is not as it's just boring
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_101.wav|no i never did mind i'm too old for minecraft
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_102.wav|too old for minecraft
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_103.wav|or what it roll blocks
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_104.wav|no my my little cousin
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_105.wav|younger much younger than me they play they play roblox so for me minecraft
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_106.wav|sounds like for kids
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_108.wav|i don't have
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_109.wav|game development
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_110.wav|training i don't know how to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_111.wav|make a game like that i have friends that make video games actually
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_112.wav|in small video game developers
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_113.wav|but i can't do that i don't know how to do that is very interesting because
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_114.wav|games are also
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_115.wav|a form of advertising it's a product it is business
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_116.wav|so i think i understand yeah yeah so i understand
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_117.wav|what needs to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_118.wav|understand the process of what needs to happen to make successful game but i think making the game designing characters
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_119.wav|i don't know how to i don't have that skill i am i'm more more trained in other area
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_122.wav|be another conversation full conversation but
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_123.wav|i think it also has to be very dynamic and needs to take into account
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_126.wav|is interested in new environments
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_127.wav|is interested in being challenged
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_128.wav|because if a game is too easy they play and they never play again what is something that can psychologically how can you attract and attract and attract
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_129.wav|to keep the player to come back to spend money i think players like achieving goals
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_133.wav|the psychology yeah yeah exactly the color psychology of gaming
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_134.wav|is very interesting because it has to do with a lot of the reward
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_136.wav|not only you get
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_137.wav|from outside of video games but it takes the same system and uses them for video games so
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_138.wav|psychology wise if you are good psychologist i think you may be very good at helping design video game yeah
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_6_6_139.wav|it's very cool very very cool stuff
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_0.wav|so i'm very excited to talk about this because
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_1.wav|the first two years of my graduate school i was the vice president of a science and food club
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_3.wav|the topic of science
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_4.wav|and topics of science but using food as our
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_5.wav|as our way to explain to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_6.wav|scientists and non-scientists how certain topics
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_7.wav|interact but with within food
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_8.wav|so i remember you with in food so you always think about chemistry as happening in the lab happening in
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_9.wav|beakers and glass tubes always always you know someone in lab coat
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_11.wav|one thing that my friend and i she was the president i was the vice president we wanted to use food is something the way that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_12.wav|everyone knows about but there are still scientific concepts that you can apply and it and use
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_13.wav|to help people understand complex science
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_14.wav|in something that they enjoy a lot of people enjoy food
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_15.wav|so i yeah yeah so i remember i helped her actually when she was she was a graduate student and so for her she was a graduate student in
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_16.wav|very similar program like i was which was a
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_17.wav|molecular biology she was more
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_18.wav|i forget the name mcip integrative physiology integrative physiology so she was more
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_19.wav|more broad while mine was focused on cell biology
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_20.wav|or dna molecules biological molecules while they were more her program was more
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_21.wav|medical oriented
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_22.wav|anyway one thing that we did because we wanted to start this club is
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_23.wav|have people not be so afraid of scientific concepts because
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_24.wav|that would be very isolating for someone that maybe is not good at critical thinking but still has an interest in learning
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_26.wav|these topics in in a way that is is easy
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_27.wav|so using food is not is not threatening
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_28.wav|when suffer some people especially if there are very young if they're in college they don't know what to decide to study
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_29.wav|they may see a lab they may think it's very hard which it is it is very hard
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_30.wav|but food is not as threatening is not as intimidating
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_31.wav|and for some people if they have an interest that means they can also work
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_32.wav|a lot harder towards it
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_33.wav|without feeling like they are going to fail
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_34.wav|so we thought that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_35.wav|combining the science the chemistry
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_36.wav|the biology with something that people were
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_37.wav|attracted to something that is very popular that people can relate to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_39.wav|that was one of the best ways to help raise awareness and teach people in a very accessible manner so
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_40.wav|i did that for two years two years and then i had to focus more on my research yes so i
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_41.wav|wrong wrong wrong wrong
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_42.wav|i did it for three years
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_43.wav|i did it for three years yes three of my five and a half years when i was a
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_44.wav|graduate student
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_45.wav|three years yes
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_48.wav|graduate student at least in the united states you have to teach
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_49.wav|a class every year every
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_50.wav|every other year so that was part of her teaching requirement and her class was
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_51.wav|very much going into the science of food would they they went to a liberal laboratory but instead of
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_52.wav|taking measurements of of
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_53.wav|solutions of measuring powders and creating things like in a chemistry lab
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_54.wav|they would find out what is the best way to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_55.wav|melt butter what is the best way to make a dressing dressing can be a mixture of oil and usually water it's an emulsion
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_56.wav|the term is the molten you know you think about water and oil they do not mix
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_57.wav|but they in fact do
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_59.wav|no you have to well it's not it won't taste very good that's another thing they wanted to combine science to to improve taste
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_60.wav|but the property of mixing oil and water exist
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_61.wav|in regular grocery store you find it all the time the salad dressing like the sesame
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_62.wav|oil dressing you see at the comb beanie
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_63.wav|or that you see at the grocery store that is mixing of water and feel
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_64.wav|so we wanted to that that is just one example but that is something that we wanted the club and her class to also understand that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_65.wav|just because they learn about science chemistry physics
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_66.wav|in these very
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_67.wav|concrete these very
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_68.wav|boring ways
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_69.wav|it doesn't have to be boring
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_72.wav|yeah it's just it was just more it was just more exciting and i think
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_73.wav|when people get to understand that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_75.wav|different context of applying these
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_76.wav|these complicated
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_77.wav|topics into something that is fun into something that's interactive
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_80.wav|gives you a lot more data that gives you a lot more community
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_83.wav|someone that is in the lab and one that is outside of the lab there's more of that communication i think that is very important for advancing
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_84.wav|not only the science field but i think any field that that level of understanding
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_85.wav|so i remember let's see yes
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_86.wav|and so one thing that i remember
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_87.wav|learning about is something called the my yard reaction
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_88.wav|that's based off of a french scientist my yard reaction
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_89.wav|so back to french french and food a i ll ll
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_94.wav|but you have experienced it you have experienced it every single time you
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_95.wav|make food you experience it every single time you go to the bakery
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_96.wav|you experience it every time you eat a nice steak that is a reaction that you have
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_97.wav|multiple times a day
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_98.wav|so it is what sometimes can give food flavor when you cook food the my yard reaction
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_100.wav|caramelization yes so you've mentioned that before
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_103.wav|mean by the chinese cuisine
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_106.wav|that's actually
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_107.wav|a good point because not only does
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_108.wav|the type of food have the molecules that then get
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_109.wav|broken down to give you the sweet or even the the savory is that the my yard reaction
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_110.wav|talks about but you're right that sometimes sugar sometimes wine the cooking wine
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_111.wav|can add more flavor because it's it's the same it's the same reaction that that makes these molecules
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_113.wav|react yeah the molly yeah they get broken up and that is what you taste and it tastes so good
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_114.wav|so for me i like having you
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_115.wav|a nice steak
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_116.wav|maybe that's cooked a
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_117.wav|medium medium well
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_118.wav|actually no medium is good you know do you know what i mean by
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_119.wav|the type of cooking on a stake
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_121.wav|yes you've got you have you have rare and then you so main three main three main types is rare medium well-done and then in between is
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_122.wav|rare medium rare medium
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_123.wav|medium well well done i like something in between the medium medium is very good
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_127.wav|there yeah so there's certain and i'm not trained as a chef i'm not trained as a chef but
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_128.wav|some people are very strict about how they like their steak
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_129.wav|it needs to be this type of cooking
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_130.wav|and that is that is also very important i think many chefs need to
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_131.wav|consider the chemical reaction that happens when you cook for example the steak
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_132.wav|when it turns from
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_133.wav|the the muscle because steak is muscle when it oxidizes to turn brown
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_7_7_134.wav|there's a change in the molecular composition yes yes so the there is a change in the molecular composition
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_0.wav|because of the way that you cook it on just with heat the heat oxidizes the molecules in muscle
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_1.wav|and be as a result of this process it becomes darker tone comes brown and then the sugars can also get broken down amino acids the building blocks
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_3.wav|life the organic
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_4.wav|the sugar is still a part is still one of the molecules we have sugars that are naturally occurring in our body
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_5.wav|but also there are sugars that naturally you can add into your your dish so you are doing chemistry in the kitchen
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_6.wav|if you want to do more chemistry you just have to cook more but that means also dishes and preparation
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_7.wav|so i like cooking as a result i like cooking because it is chemistry different chemistry but it reminds me of
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_8.wav|being in a lab it reminds me of being able to mix
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_9.wav|and match sometimes i don't follow directions sharon's
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_10.wav|so not very good not very good scientist
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_12.wav|anyway the science and food club was
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_13.wav|very successful when i was a graduate student
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_14.wav|i was able to help recruit both
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_15.wav|scientists and chefs
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_16.wav|to talk about different areas of either how to improve
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_17.wav|certain types of cooking or how to learn certain types of cooking
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_18.wav|because as a college student also when you think about cooking you have to think about nutrition you need to think about how to cook
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_19.wav|well and that can help with your just will focus on your health and
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_20.wav|that is something that is not taught in school
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_22.wav|the chef's that we would invite sometimes we talk about attrition some of them were more focused on nutrition and focused on making dish dishes that could help college students
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_25.wav|someone at the door sorry
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_27.wav|other chefs were focusing more on type of cuisine
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_28.wav|scientists for example would talk about how to make now that is more popular but back then how to make
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_29.wav|a steak without making it part of an animal so alternative mean how do you make fish without getting it from a fish how do you make meat without getting it from a chicken a cow how do you get it from not an animal
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_30.wav|can you make a lab steak
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_31.wav|and yes the the answer is yes you can make a lab steak but
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_32.wav|even steak when you think about steak you go to the grocery store it has many different cell types it is not just one cell type
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_33.wav|that you can grow in the lab you have to make a combination that is a tissue
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_34.wav|tissue means you have different
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_36.wav|in one area and that also is what contributes to taste
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_39.wav|muscle tissue to some extent even immune immune ology
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_41.wav|so because we are very viewed life organic life is very complex
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_42.wav|if you were to eat it also is a complex taste
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_43.wav|but some people don't want to continue eating
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_44.wav|any animal products because it does affect the environment
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_45.wav|ethical reasons they do not want to eat meat
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_46.wav|so this scientist
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_47.wav|one of the scientists that we did invite about alternative meat actually we became vegan
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_48.wav|so no animal meat at all
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_49.wav|but still was working on meat that was ethical so they still were able to get
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_50.wav|some cells from
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_51.wav|meats like yes they got cells from a cow
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_53.wav|but the cow was not killed it was not injured non-invasive
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_55.wav|to then make into a steak yeah
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_56.wav|so that was it's a little bit more complicated
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_58.wav|that was some of
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_59.wav|they are not just yet they use animal but not animal they use a plant base
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_62.wav|idea being how can you still make you need to still study the original source the animal if you want to make a product that is still very good
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_64.wav|that and not everybody will want
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_67.wav|because i think i think the plant protein is very carbohydrate heavy so certain nutritional
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_68.wav|things are not ideal
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_69.wav|there are yeah there's there's good things and bad things about beyond meat
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_72.wav|how often someone can can eat it
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_73.wav|so the idea being with this all its alternative meet that the scientists was talking about but
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_74.wav|alternative meet that it was still became it still was from
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_75.wav|a cow it still was stake
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_76.wav|by definition
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_77.wav|but the cow was not
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_78.wav|was ethically treated it was not harmed
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_79.wav|and then the research that
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_80.wav|their research involved with
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_81.wav|how can from one cell how can you make
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_83.wav|and have it taste like a steak
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_84.wav|it sounds very simple but it's so complicated
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_86.wav|that is a bit of a subjective question
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_88.wav|it would have the yeah i do i can't answer that because i never try this
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_90.wav|but when i have eight of when i have tried this beyond meat when i have tried the impossible burger it tastes fine to me i don't eat it i don't eat very much meat to begin with i eat more vegetables i eat more fish
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_91.wav|i prefer fish and beans
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_94.wav|but it's still very interesting being able to combine that's why we wanted to continue with with this we wanted to combine different areas because not everybody thinks about
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_95.wav|a scientist doing food-related work
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_96.wav|but it very much is
DUMMY/BEAT/9_cropped/wav_22/9_miranda_1_8_8_97.wav|we are not chefs not not not all scientists can cook that is a reality not all scientists are very good at cooking
